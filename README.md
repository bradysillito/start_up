# StartFit

Welcome to the StartFit repository! This project showcases my skills in front-end design and full-stack development, employing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The live demo is accessible at [https://startup.startfit.click](https://startup.startfit.click), with the backend and APIs hosted on AWS. Stay tuned for upcoming releases, including a React version of the front end and a React Native application.

## Purpose

For novice weightlifters, the key to progress lies in understanding the concept of progressive overload. Simply put, each workout should surpass the previous one in terms of weight or reps. Fueled by my personal commitment to health, I meticulously tracked my workouts, reps, and weights in a physical notebook for over a year. However, referencing past workouts became challenging, prompting the development of this website.

## Lessons Learned

This project served as a platform to solidify the concept and demonstrate proficiency in design and implementation. In a landscape rife with feature-laden distractions, I focused on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that is both simple and effective. Despite its simplicity, this project challenged me to thoroughly think through my solutions.

## Next Steps

The evolution of this application continues with the development of React and React Native versions. Planned features include a progress graph over time, the ability to view individual exercises side by side, and a comprehensive overview of the entire workout. Additionally, I aim to implement a smart suggestion feature based on your previous workouts, enhancing the user experience by recommending exercises based on preferences and history. Your fitness journey just got smarter and more streamlined!
